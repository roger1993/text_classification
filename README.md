# text_classification
Testing program
I use the pretrained glove.6B.100d for the word embedding, the file could be downloaded from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/, the current problem is this pretrained dictionary just has few Chinese characters, the word embedding is upmost for the deep learning approach.
